roads and boats


work out how to do roads when there's a river splitting a tile...

add things to draw buildings/transporters/goods


how to interact with the board? maybe a button outside to end the phase, but click on transporters to do stuff? and a label & button(s) outside to handle when there are options like whether to put goods from a transporter into a factory

add research bar display
add research to game state

add some tests - could set up a new game, run through a list of saved commands and check the end state
